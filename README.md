a collection of Godot solution code, small snippets as examples designed for easy copy and pasting

it's just my personal collection like a scrapbook, so i can quickly paste various patterns i would constantly forget and avoid google


most snippets are presented as an easy to use encapsulated function

some things like CSG can only really be encapsulated as an object, some things are better as an object (CSV reading for example) but sosmetimes one shot functions are still desirable.

Recently i was trying to make the "cogs" library to hypthosise on my perfect library at least. This will use a strict OO model ... it would do common things like for example there are no 2D arrays, so make an object to encapsulate a PoolRealArray... most of us realise okay we could use a PoolArray as a 2D or multidimensional array.. however this library would save you that 10 minutes and create the idea of a "standard approach"
