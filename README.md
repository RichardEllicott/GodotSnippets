a collection of Godot solution code, small snippets as examples designed for easy copy and pasting

it's just my personal collection, so i can quickly paste various patterns and save code i think is clever so i don't loose it


most snippets are presented as an easy to use ecapsulated function

some things like CSG can only really be encapsulated in an object, but the object should be presented as minimal as possible
