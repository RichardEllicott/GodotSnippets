a collection of Godot solution code, small snippets as examples designed for easy copy and pasting

I'm currently mainly working on the shaders section.... my shaders are designed to be short and concise, and work standalone



If you are new to godot, this is a quick guide to loading a shader:


-Create a scene (typically a Sprite or ColorRect).

-If you are using a Sprite, ensure you have a texture loaded.

-Select the material, and create a new ShaderMaterial

-Select to edit the material

-In the materials, "shader" property, load one of the shader files.

-You may need to edit the "Shader Param" to actually see the shader, and get the effect you want.
