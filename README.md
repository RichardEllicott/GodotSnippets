a collection of Godot solution code, small snippets as examples

please ask if you need assistance (however it works on github i guess)... like i have no idea how to write docs but i wanted to present some simple examples of stuff that are self explanatory (however if they're not please ask that simple question, then i add an FAQ or something)

note the license is public domain, because the library is designed for copy and pasting
