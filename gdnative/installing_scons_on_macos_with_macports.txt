scons is required for compiling the Godot source code and also that it uses Python 3


i decided to use macports as it's smaller and brew seems to take a long time and i get issues with it


WARNING: sudo port install scons # will install an older scons, that's why i use pips instead to install scons 


install macports:
	https://www.macports.org


run commands:
	sudo port install python39 # install python 3.9	
	sudo port install py39-pip # install pip

	sudo port select --set python3 python39 # set default python3 as python39
	sudo port select --set pip3 pip39 # set default pip3 as pip39

	pip3 install scons # should be to a user directory, run with no sudo
		

add to "~./bash_profile":
	alias scons="python3 -m SCons" # run python3 with module (-m) "SCons"




ADDITIONAL:
the python installs scons here:
~/Library/Python/3.9/lib/python/site-packages/SCons/__main__.py
