Blender 2.8.1, setting up my preferences:

Edit->Preferences:
	->Keymap->Blender27X
	->Preferences->Select with RMB
	->Input->Keyboard->Emulate Numpad (for laptop)


This should also ensure the period (.) zooms to the current selection (on some blender versions may need to be set manually)




Important Shortcuts (i tend to forget), note I used 27X shortcuts:


SHIFT+CTRL+ALT (enables you to set the origin of an object the the 3D cursor or other places)
SHIFT+F (fly mode)
ALT+F (moves the view to the 3D cursor
CTRL+ALT+0 (set camera to view (works cool pressing NUM1 for flat position first))
CTRL+L copy modifiers from last selected to others


SHIFT+S (to move 3D cursor to origin)
SHIFT+C (reset 3D cursor)

seemed to be okay:
