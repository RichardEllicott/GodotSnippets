Blender 2.81, setting up my preferences:

Edit->Preferences:
	->Keymap->Blender27X
	->Preferences->Select with RMB
	->Input->Keyboard->Emulate Numpad (for laptop)


I like the grid to be divided by 8 squares (for doubling sizes)
Blenders 2.81 overlays menu is at the top right of the viewport, to the left of the shading and xray buttons, it looks like two circles overlaying each other. The dropdown next to it allows setting this.... HOWEVER IT DOES NOT WORK until 2.82 :(

This should also ensure the period (.) zooms to the current selection (on some blender versions may need to be set manually)




Important Shortcuts (i tend to forget), note I used 27X shortcuts:


SHIFT+CTRL+ALT (enables you to set the origin of an object the the 3D cursor or other places)
SHIFT+F (fly mode)
ALT+F (moves the view to the 3D cursor
CTRL+ALT+0 (set camera to view (works cool pressing NUM1 for flat position first))
CTRL+L copy modifiers from last selected to others


SHIFT+S (to move 3D cursor to origin)
SHIFT+C (reset 3D cursor)

seemed to be okay:

World scale notes:

American Doors:

One of the most common front door sizes in American houses is 36 inches (91.44 cm) wide by 80 inches (203.2 cm) tall, and almost 2 inches (5.08 cm) thick. However, not all doors will have these measurements. Doors can be as narrow as 30 inches (76.2 cm) and as tall as 96 inches (2.4384 m), and thickness can depend on the door material.

People:

Males average height: 171 cm
Female: 159 cm
Trump: 190 cm

Office building quick: use 4 meters per a floor, 1 meter gap, would contain ducting, plumbing, steel infrastructure and flooring
I make the floor level with the 0 plane (lower the outside pavement)
I use stairs that are 4 steps per a meter, that means they're 25 cm tall


Standard Step Height
On average, American architects have used a standard stair height of 7.5 inches (19.05 cm) . On stairs built inside, the average step length is 9 inches (22.86 cm) tall, while outside steps have an average length of 11 (27.94 cm) inches tall

Stair better:
5 Answers. The general rule (in the US) is 7-11 (a 7 inch rise and 11 inch run) (17.78cm-27.94cm). More exactly, no more than 7 3/4 inches (19.7cm) for the riser
