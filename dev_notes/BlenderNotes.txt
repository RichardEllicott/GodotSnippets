Blender 2.81, setting up my preferences:

Edit->Preferences:
	->Keymap->Blender27X
	->Preferences->Select with RMB
	->Input->Keyboard->Emulate Numpad (for laptop)


I like the grid to be divided by 8 squares (for doubling sizes)
Blenders 2.81 overlays menu is at the top right of the viewport, to the left of the shading and xray buttons, it looks like two circles overlaying each other. The dropdown next to it allows setting this.... HOWEVER IT DOES NOT WORK until 2.82 :(

This should also ensure the period (.) zooms to the current selection (on some blender versions may need to be set manually)




Important Shortcuts (i tend to forget), note I used 27X shortcuts:

Front (orographic) 1
Right (orographic) 3
Top (orographic) 7



SHIFT+CTRL+ALT (enables you to set the origin of an object the the 3D cursor or other places)
SHIFT+F (fly mode)
ALT+F (moves the view to the 3D cursor
CTRL+ALT+0 (set camera to view (works cool pressing NUM1 for flat position first))
CTRL+L copy modifiers from last selected to others
CMD+A (apply modifiers like rotation and scale etc)

ALT+C (convert metaballs to mesh (convert mesh))

SHIFT+S (to move 3D cursor to origin)
SHIFT+C (reset 3D cursor)

seemed to be okay:
