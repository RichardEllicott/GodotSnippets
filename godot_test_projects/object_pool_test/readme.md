Torture Test Designed to show that pooling can make a difference in some scenarios.



I get slowdown if i assign several hidden meshes to each bullet.
These meshes are not rendered, they only serve to tax the system resources.


In the case that say 50 mesh cubes are being loaded along with each bullet.


My computer will spaz out if they are not pooled. Instead they are constantly being created and destroyed.





However in most normal scenarios you can't produce any benefits from this object pooling.
