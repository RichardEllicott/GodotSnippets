compiling a collection of modular scripts that can be used together


for example:

	a fps controller
	separate shoot raycast script
	separate launch rigid body script


so they can in theory be used together utilizing Godot's node based design




very messy at the moment, cos im still working on it .... at the moment it's mainly an experimental FPS collection
